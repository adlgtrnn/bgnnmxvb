		<p>I can’t do anything about it.  One of my sons, who played a quarter-back on a college football team, developed the habit of clicking loudly a rubber band around his wrist after a match in which he or his teammates made a serious mistake, as if to put a psychological end to the experience.  As we grow older and mature, we become more and more clearly aware that everything in nature is interdependent, that there is a certain ecological system that governs nature, including human society.  As you develop a family mission statement, you formulate its fundamental foundations.This Mission becomes the constitution of the family, the norm, the criterion for making judgments and decisions.  MONOPOLY Monopoly is a market structure in which one firm is a supplier of goods that have no close substitutes on the market.  But our deep mutual desire and tacit agreement was to set ourselves up and start where we left off in order to finally achieve a solution to the problem.  However, experience and observation tell a different story.Over the years I have had to deal with many dysfunctional marriages.  Our conviction is well expressed in the words of the Psalmist: "Seek in your heart with diligence, for from it flow the rivers of life." Primary and Secondary Experiences for our son, my study of perception and reading of literature about success - all this combined led me suddenly to the discovery: “This is it!”, When suddenly everything falls into place.  Brand names, which are the commercial name of an enterprise, are inextricably linked with its business reputation.  - All right, dad, I'm tired! Who needs this school! - You feel very disappointed with the school. </p>

		<p>Since it is meant to work for you, it must be tailored to your style, your needs, your personality.  Now the daughter could satisfy her own transportation needs and even some of ours.  The idea of ​​the existence and power of these principles is well illustrated in the story of Frank Koch's paradigm shift experience published in the "Notes" - the journal of the Naval Institute: “Two warships of the training squadron had to spend several days on maneuvers in the stormy sea.  For example, if the price of butter has risen, then the demand for it decreases.  So dad, it's not necessary at all.  As a board member of your organization, you can try to directly influence its culture, but your Circle of Influence may not yet be wide enough to actually influence the culture of FAM, so you simply submit to their demands.  The elasticity changes as it moves down the demand curve. </p>

The regularity of changes in long-term average costs is their initial decrease with the expansion of production capacity and growth in production.  The results are like miracles.  - Why not apply the same principle here? “Okay, I'll give you an example,” said my interlocutor.  Along with the above, completely competitive markets presuppose other conditions: 1) an instant reaction of supply and demand to market signals, which should ensure the establishment of market equilibrium; 2) the existence of a market for goods on hand, in which sellers and buyers meet at the same time, in the same place; 3) the absence of any costs associated with the transaction between producers and consumers.  How accurate were your assumptions? How correctly did you understand your partner's point of view? 2. </p>
